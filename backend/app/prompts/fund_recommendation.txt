${user_fund_details_json}

And this User Feedback History (if any):
${user_feedback_json}

Task:
1. Analyze the User Feedback to identify their preferences (Risk, Category, Interests).
2. Categorize each feedback entry into: INTERESTED, NOT_INTERESTED, TOO_RISKY, PREFER_DIFFERENT_CATEGORY.
3. Recommend EXACTLY 5 mutual funds for diversification, strictly adhering to the user's feedback (e.g., avoid funds similar to "NOT_INTERESTED" or "TOO_RISKY" feedback).
4. Ensure recommended funds are suitable for the User's Budget (e.g. minimum investment amount should be within or near the budget).
